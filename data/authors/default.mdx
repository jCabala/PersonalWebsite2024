I'm really passionate about both math and programming, with interests that range from web development and blockchain to measure theory and abstract algebra. I've loved math since primary school, and I got into programming a few years later in middle school. I've decided to study both subjects in university because I could never pick a favorite, and now I'm more torn than ever.

In this blog, I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences with both math and programming. I'll also post updates on my progress and what's happening at university. Whether you're into these topics or just curious, I hope you'll enjoy following along!
